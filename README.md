## Milestone 1 (29th March, 5pm)

**10% of the final grade**

This is a preliminary milestone to let you set up goals for your final project and assess the feasibility of your ideas.
Please, fill the following sections about your project.

*(max. 2000 characters per section)*

### Dataset

> Find a dataset (or multiple) that you will explore. Assess the quality of the data it contains and how much preprocessing / data-cleaning it will require before tackling visualization. We recommend using a standard dataset as this course is not about scraping nor data processing.
>
> Hint: some good pointers for finding quality publicly available datasets ([Google dataset search](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/), [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets), [OpenSwissData](https://opendata.swiss/en/), [SNAP](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/) and [FiveThirtyEight](https://data.fivethirtyeight.com/)), you could use also the DataSets proposed by the ENAC (see the Announcements section on Zulip).

### Problematic

Initiated in 1950, Formula 1 racing stands as the pinnacle of motor racing competitions globally, renowned for its prestige and widespread popularity. The 2019 FIA Formula One World Championship unfolded from March to December, comprising 21 races held across four continents and spanning 21 countries, marking it as the foremost annual sporting series worldwide.

While on the surface it may seem like a solo sport where the responsibility is solely on the driver, however, we see that it is, in fact, a textbook team sport.

For this project, we aim to make F1 accessible to those with a novice to intermediate understanding of motor racing, but who require a more visual explanation to comprehend the intricacies of the sport. We will focus on visualizations that talk about not only the Driver’s statistics across the grand prix races, but also look at other factors like the shape of the circuit, car performance, rule changes, team performance as whole, and race calendars.

More specifically, our research aims to visualise the following questions:
1. How does the shape and length of a circuit affect race outcomes? 
2. Can we identify any trends related to specific circuit features (e.g., elevation changes, tight corners, long straights) and their impact on race results?
3. How do individual drivers’ performance metrics (such as lap times, finishing positions, and fastest laps) vary across different circuits?
4. Which drivers (or driver pairs) consistently perform well across various seasons, and how has their performance evolved over time?

### Exploratory Data Analysis

> Pre-processing of the data set you chose
> - Show some basic statistics and get insights about the data

1. In [this website](https://jasonjpaul.squarespace.com/formula-1-data-vis), Jason Paul outlines his process for understanding who is the greatest driver of all time, with a unique storytelling approach which acts as a choose-your-own-adventure structure for the user to click through.
2. [This](https://f1-visualization.vercel.app) website, developed by Yannick Gloster, allows the user to see the race in an interesting dynamic visualisation, but does not provide much more information.
3. [This](https://uxdesign.cc/visualizing-career-flows-in-sports-formula-1-3d88feca257c) visualisation is a static representation of the entire career of a particular team or a driver.

Our visualisation aims to be dynamic and interactive, while simultaneously guiding the user through the platform. We will talk about not only the driver or the team itself, but also the effect of the environment on their performance. In essence, we hope to differentiate ourselves by catering to a larger audience and guide them through the sport.
