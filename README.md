## Milestone 1 (29th March, 5pm)

**10% of the final grade**

This is a preliminary milestone to let you set up goals for your final project and assess the feasibility of your ideas.
Please, fill the following sections about your project.

*(max. 2000 characters per section)*

### Dataset

> Find a dataset (or multiple) that you will explore. Assess the quality of the data it contains and how much preprocessing / data-cleaning it will require before tackling visualization. We recommend using a standard dataset as this course is not about scraping nor data processing.
>
> Hint: some good pointers for finding quality publicly available datasets ([Google dataset search](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/), [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets), [OpenSwissData](https://opendata.swiss/en/), [SNAP](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/) and [FiveThirtyEight](https://data.fivethirtyeight.com/)), you could use also the DataSets proposed by the ENAC (see the Announcements section on Zulip).

### Problematic

Initiated in 1950, Formula 1 stands as the pinnacle of motor sport, renowned for its prestige, widespread popularity and technical brilliance. Considered one of the most data-driven sports, modern Formula 1 cars have 300 sensors producing approximately 100,000 data points per second, accumulating [1.5 terabytes of data over the course of a race](https://www.forbes.com/sites/joelshapiro/2023/01/26/data-driven-at-200-mph-how-analytics-transforms-formula-one-racing/?sh=6f330cc639db). All this data is analyzed to inform everything from car design to racing strategy and driver skill.

For this project, we aim to make F1 accessible to those with a novice to intermediate understanding of motor racing, but who require a more visual explanation to comprehend the intricacies of the sport. We will focus on visualizations that talk about not only the Driver’s statistics across seasons and grand prix races, but also look at other factors like circuits, car performance, race calendars and point scoring-rules.

More specifically, our project aims to provide visualisations for exploring the following:
1. How would a different point scoring system affect seasonal championship outcomes? 
2. Driver and teammate battles - how are two or more drivers performing across races, qualifyings and seasons?
3. Circuit statistics - how many races have been held at a specific circuit? Which driver has had the most success there (wins, podiums, pole positions)?
5. GOAT-debate: who is the greatest driver of all time in pure numbers?
6. Race calendar environmental impact - how could the race calendar be reorganized to minimize environmental impact/rac2race travel milage? 

### Exploratory Data Analysis

> Pre-processing of the data set you chose
> Show some basic statistics and get insights about the data

1. In [this website](https://jasonjpaul.squarespace.com/formula-1-data-vis), Jason Paul outlines his process for understanding who is the greatest driver of all time, with a unique storytelling approach which acts as a choose-your-own-adventure structure for the user to click through.
2. [This](https://f1-visualization.vercel.app) website, developed by Yannick Gloster, allows the user to see the race in an interesting dynamic visualisation, but does not provide much more information.
3. [This](https://uxdesign.cc/visualizing-career-flows-in-sports-formula-1-3d88feca257c) visualisation is a static representation of the entire career of a particular team or a driver, designed by Ruban B.
4. [This](https://www.f1-tempo.com) website lets the user create simple Formula 1 lap time and telemetry graphs utlizing data from [Fast-F1](https://github.com/theOehrly/Fast-F1/tree/master).

Our visualisation aims to be dynamic and interactive, while simultaneously guiding the user through the platform. While the visualisations should invite exploration, we also seek to present new insights regarding the impact(s) of point systems, race calendars and rule changes. While not an entirely novel topic, we aim to differentiate ourselves by bringing new perspectives through an interesting and interactive data story catering a broad audience.
